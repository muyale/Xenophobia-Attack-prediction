# Xenophobia-Attack-prediction
Our African content has been adversely affected by Xenophobia .In countries such as Uganda and South Africa there have been several xenophobic attacks on foreigners .

Xenophobia  is the fear or dislike of anything which is perceived as being foreign or strange. It is an expression which is based on the perception that a conflict exists between an in-group and an out-group and it may manifest itself in suspicion of one group's activities by members of the other group, a desire to eliminate the presence of the group which is the target of suspicion, and fear of losing a national, ethnic, or racial identity. Xenophobia is like racism, but instead of fearing or distrusting people because of the color of their skin, you fear or distrust them because of their nationality, or because they are foreign to you.
In South Africa Xenophobia was  due to the fact that the residents feared strangers ,felt as if the foreigners grabbed more economic activities than they had themselves and also because of the national discourse brought about by the #southafrican government . These attacks were physical and sometimes digital. Digital xenophobic attacks included  anti-immigrant hashtags flooding South African cyberspace. On Twitter, hashtags like ‘All foreigners must leave’, ‘We want our country back’ or ‘Clean up SA’ were trending, with ‘Put South Africa First’ being used over 16,000 times within a single day . These tweets led to even more of the attacks .

Basing on this problem , I incorporated #machinelearning with a data set of some of the tweets which were already classified according to their sentiments,  location ,likes and number of replies and the task was #modeling #xenophobia  using this data and then predict future attack .
I used DataAnalysis to study the relationship between variables for example no of likes and the number of attacks .I also used #machinelearning by choosing a #randomforest model .I capped the project with DeepLearning where I build a neuralnetwork with my inputs ,trained the network, came up with a model to solve my problem.
